<p>Pseudo-random number generators are algorithms to produce apparently random
numbers deterministically, and usually fairly quickly. See the documentation
of the <a href="../rngs/index.html"><code>rngs</code> module</a> for some introduction to PRNGs.</p>
<p>As mentioned there, PRNGs fall in two broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#basic-pseudo-random-number-generators-prngs">basic PRNGs</a>, primarily designed for simulations</li>
<li><a href="#cryptographically-secure-pseudo-random-number-generators-csprngs">CSPRNGs</a>, primarily designed for cryptography</li>
</ul>
<p>In simple terms, the basic PRNGs are often predictable; CSPRNGs should not
be predictable <em>when used correctly</em>.</p>

<p>The goal of regular, non-cryptographic PRNGs is usually to find a good
balance between simplicity, quality, memory usage and performance. These
algorithms are very important to Monte Carlo simulations, and also suitable
for several other problems such as randomized algorithms and games (except
where there is a risk of players predicting the next output value from
previous values, in which case a CSPRNG should be used).</p>
<p>Currently Rand provides only one PRNG, and not a very good one at that:</p>

<h2 id="cryptographically-secure-pseudo-random-number-generators-csprngs" class="section-header"><a href="#cryptographically-secure-pseudo-random-number-generators-csprngs">Cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators (CSPRNGs)</a></h2>
<p>CSPRNGs have much higher requirements than basic PRNGs. The primary
consideration is security. Performance and simplicity are also important,
but in general CSPRNGs are more complex and slower than regular PRNGs.
Quality is no longer a concern, as it is a requirement for a
CSPRNG that the output is basically indistinguishable from true randomness
since any bias or correlation makes the output more predictable.</p>
<p>There is a close relationship between CSPRNGs and cryptographic ciphers.
Any block cipher can be turned into a CSPRNG by encrypting a counter. Stream
ciphers are basically a CSPRNG and a combining operation, usually XOR. This
means that we can easily use any stream cipher as a CSPRNG.</p>
<p>Rand currently provides two trustworthy CSPRNGs and two CSPRNG-like PRNGs:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>name</th><th>full name</th><th>performance</th><th>initialization</th><th>memory</th><th>predictability</th><th>forward secrecy</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><a href="chacha/struct.ChaChaRng.html"><code>ChaChaRng</code></a></td><td>ChaCha20</td><td>★☆☆☆☆</td><td>fast</td><td>136 bytes</td><td>secure</td><td>no</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="hc128/struct.Hc128Rng.html"><code>Hc128Rng</code></a></td><td>HC-128</td><td>★★☆☆☆</td><td>slow</td><td>4176 bytes</td><td>secure</td><td>no</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="isaac/struct.IsaacRng.html"><code>IsaacRng</code></a></td><td>ISAAC</td><td>★★☆☆☆</td><td>slow</td><td>2072 bytes</td><td>unknown</td><td>unknown</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="isaac64/struct.Isaac64Rng.html"><code>Isaac64Rng</code></a></td><td>ISAAC-64</td><td>★★☆☆☆</td><td>slow</td><td>4136 bytes</td><td>unknown</td><td>unknown</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>It should be noted that the ISAAC generators are only included for
historical reasons, they have been with the Rust language since the very
beginning. They have good quality output and no attacks are known, but have
received little attention from cryptography experts.</p>
<h1 id="performance" class="section-header"><a href="#performance">Performance</a></h1>
<p>First it has to be said most PRNGs are very fast, and will rarely be a
performance bottleneck.</p>
<p>Performance of basic PRNGs is a bit of a subtle thing. It depends a lot on
the CPU architecture (32 vs. 64 bits), inlining, and also on the number of
available registers. This often causes the performance to be affected by
surrounding code due to inlining and other usage of registers.</p>
<p>When choosing a PRNG for performance it is important to benchmark your own
application due to interactions between PRNGs and surrounding code and
dependence on the CPU architecture as well as the impact of the size of
data requested. Because of all this, we do not include performance numbers
here but merely a qualitative rating.</p>
<p>CSPRNGs are a little different in that they typically generate a block of
output in a cache, and pull outputs from the cache. This allows them to have
good amortised performance, and reduces or completely removes the influence
of surrounding code on the CSPRNG performance.</p>
<h3 id="worst-case-performance" class="section-header"><a href="#worst-case-performance">Worst-case performance</a></h3>
<p>Because CSPRNGs usually produce a block of values into a cache, they have
poor worst case performance (in contrast to basic PRNGs, where the
performance is usually quite regular).</p>
<h2 id="state-size" class="section-header"><a href="#state-size">State size</a></h2>
<p>Simple PRNGs often use very little memory, commonly only a few words, where
a <em>word</em> is usually either <code>u32</code> or <code>u64</code>. This is not true for all
non-cryptographic PRNGs however, for example the historically popular
Mersenne Twister MT19937 algorithm requires 2.5 kB of state.</p>
<p>CSPRNGs typically require more memory; since the seed size is recommended
to be at least 192 bits and some more may be required for the algorithm,
256 bits would be approximately the minimum secure size. In practice,
CSPRNGs tend to use quite a bit more, <a href="chacha/struct.ChaChaRng.html"><code>ChaChaRng</code></a> is relatively small with
136 bytes of state.</p>
<h2 id="initialization-time" class="section-header"><a href="#initialization-time">Initialization time</a></h2>
<p>The time required to initialize new generators varies significantly. Many
simple PRNGs and even some cryptographic ones (including <a href="chacha/struct.ChaChaRng.html"><code>ChaChaRng</code></a>)
only need to copy the seed value and some constants into their state, and
thus can be constructed very quickly. In contrast, CSPRNGs with large state
require an expensive key-expansion.</p>
<h1 id="quality" class="section-header"><a href="#quality">Quality</a></h1>
<p>Many basic PRNGs are not much more than a couple of bitwise and arithmetic
operations. Their simplicity gives good performance, but also means there
are small regularities hidden in the generated random number stream.</p>
<p>How much do those hidden regularities matter? That is hard to say, and
depends on how the RNG gets used. If there happen to be correlations between
the random numbers and the algorithm they are used in, the results can be
wrong or misleading.</p>
<p>A random number generator can be considered good if it gives the correct
results in as many applications as possible. The quality of PRNG
algorithms can be evaluated to some extend analytically, to determine the
cycle length and to rule out some correlations. Then there are empirical
test suites designed to test how well a PRNG performs on a wide range of
possible uses, the latest and most complete of which are <a href="http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/testu01/tu01.html">TestU01</a> and
<a href="http://pracrand.sourceforge.net/">PractRand</a>.</p>
<p>CSPRNGs tend to be more complex, and have an explicit requirement to be
unpredictable. This implies there must be no obvious correlations between
output values.</p>
<h3 id="quality-stars" class="section-header"><a href="#quality-stars">Quality stars:</a></h3>
<p>PRNGs with 3 stars or more should be good enough for any purpose.
1 or 2 stars may be good enough for typical apps and games, but do not work
well with all algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="period" class="section-header"><a href="#period">Period</a></h2>
<p>The <em>period</em> or <em>cycle length</em> of a PRNG is the number of values that can be
generated after which it starts repeating the same random number stream.
Many PRNGs have a fixed-size period, but for some only an expected average
cycle length can be given, where the exact length depends on the seed.</p>
<p>On today's hardware, even a fast RNG with a cycle length of <em>only</em>
2<sup>64</sup> can be used for centuries before cycling. Yet we recommend a
period of 2<sup>128</sup> or more, which most modern PRNGs satisfy.
Alternatively a PRNG with shorter period but support for multiple streams
may be chosen. There are two reasons for this, as follows.</p>
<p>If we see the entire period of an RNG as one long random number stream,
every independently seeded RNG returns a slice of that stream. When multiple
RNG are seeded randomly, there is an increasingly large chance to end up
with a partially overlapping slice of the stream.</p>
<p>If the period of the RNG is 2<sup>128</sup>, and an application consumes
2<sup>48</sup> values, it then takes about 2<sup>32</sup> random
initializations to have a chance of 1 in a million to repeat part of an
already used stream. This seems good enough for common usage of
non-cryptographic generators, hence the recommendation of at least
2<sup>128</sup>. As an estimate, the chance of any overlap in a period of
size <code>p</code> with <code>n</code> independent seeds and <code>u</code> values used per seed is
approximately <code>1 - e^(-u * n^2 / (2 * p))</code>.</p>
<p>Further, it is not recommended to use the full period of an RNG. Many
PRNGs have a property called <em>k-dimensional equidistribution</em>, meaning that
for values of some size (potentially larger than the output size), all
possible values are produced the same number of times over the generator's
period. This is not a property of true randomness. This is known as the
generalized birthday problem, see the <a href="http://www.pcg-random.org/pdf/hmc-cs-2014-0905.pdf">PCG paper</a> for a good explanation.
This results in a noticable bias on output after generating more values
than the square root of the period (after 2<sup>64</sup> values for a
period of 2<sup>128</sup>).</p>
<h1 id="security" class="section-header"><a href="#security">Security</a></h1><h2 id="predictability" class="section-header"><a href="#predictability">Predictability</a></h2>
<p>From the context of any PRNG, one can ask the question <em>given some previous
output from the PRNG, is it possible to predict the next output value?</em>
This is an important property in any situation where there might be an
adversary.</p>
<p>Regular PRNGs tend to be predictable, although with varying difficulty. In
some cases prediction is trivial, for example plain Xorshift outputs part of
its state without mutation, and prediction is as simple as seeding a new
Xorshift generator from four <code>u32</code> outputs. Other generators, like
<a href="http://www.pcg-random.org/predictability.html">PCG</a> and truncated Xorshift*
are harder to predict, but not outside the realm of common mathematics and a
desktop PC.</p>
<p>The basic security that CSPRNGs must provide is the infeasibility to predict
output. This requirement is formalized as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next-bit_test">next-bit test</a>; this is
roughly stated as: given the first <em>k</em> bits of a random sequence, the
sequence satisfies the next-bit test if there is no algorithm able to
predict the next bit using reasonable computing power.</p>
<p>A further security that <em>some</em> CSPRNGs provide is forward secrecy:
in the event that the CSPRNGs state is revealed at some point, it must be
infeasible to reconstruct previous states or output. Note that many CSPRNGs
<em>do not</em> have forward secrecy in their usual formulations.</p>
<p>As an outsider it is hard to get a good idea about the security of an
algorithm. People in the field of cryptography spend a lot of effort
analyzing existing designs, and what was once considered good may now turn
out to be weaker. Generally it is best to use algorithms well-analyzed by
experts, such as those recommended by NIST or ECRYPT.</p>
<h2 id="state-and-seeding" class="section-header"><a href="#state-and-seeding">State and seeding</a></h2>
<p>It is worth noting that a CSPRNG's security relies absolutely on being
seeded with a secure random key. Should the key be known or guessable, all
output of the CSPRNG is easy to guess. This implies that the seed should
come from a trusted source; usually either the OS or another CSPRNG. Our
seeding helper trait, <a href="../trait.FromEntropy.html"><code>FromEntropy</code></a>, and the source it uses
(<a href="../rngs/struct.EntropyRng.html"><code>EntropyRng</code></a>), should be secure. Additionally, <a href="../rngs/struct.ThreadRng.html"><code>ThreadRng</code></a> is a CSPRNG,
thus it is acceptable to seed from this (although for security applications
fresh/external entropy should be preferred).</p>
<p>Further, it should be obvious that the internal state of a CSPRNG must be
kept secret. With that in mind, our implementations do not provide direct
access to most of their internal state, and <code>Debug</code> implementations do not
print any internal state. This does not fully protect CSPRNG state; code
within the same process may read this memory (and we allow cloning and
serialisation of CSPRNGs for convenience). Further, a running process may be
forked by the operating system, which may leave both processes with a copy
of the same generator.</p>
<h2 id="not-a-crypto-library" class="section-header"><a href="#not-a-crypto-library">Not a crypto library</a></h2>
<p>It should be emphasised that this is not a cryptography library; although
Rand does take some measures to provide secure random numbers, it does not
necessarily take all recommended measures. Further, cryptographic processes
such as encryption and authentication are complex and must be implemented
very carefully to avoid flaws and resist known attacks. It is therefore
recommended to use specialized libraries where possible, for example
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/openssl">openssl</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ring">ring</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/RustCrypto">RustCrypto libraries</a>.</p>
<h1 id="extra-features" class="section-header"><a href="#extra-features">Extra features</a></h1>
<p>Some PRNGs may provide extra features, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for multiple streams, which can help with parallel tasks.</li>
<li>The ability to jump or seek around in the random number stream;
with large periood this can be used as an alternative to streams.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="further-reading" class="section-header"><a href="#further-reading">Further reading</a></h1>
<p>There is quite a lot that can be said about PRNGs. The <a href="http://www.pcg-random.org/pdf/hmc-cs-2014-0905.pdf">PCG paper</a> is a
very approachable explaining more concepts.</p>
