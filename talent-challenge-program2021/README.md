# Talent Challenge Program

Talent Challenge program is a platform that offers a structured remote mentoring program for **college students** successfully completing talent plan courses or having contributed to TiDB projects. Open source projects related to TiDB ecosystems will be selected together with professional mentors. Students **successfully completing talent plan courses or having contributed to TiDB projects** can apply for the projects, one at a time, and finish the projects with the help of the mentors in a given time.
