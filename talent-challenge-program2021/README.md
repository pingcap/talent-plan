# Talent Challenge Program 2021

Talent Challenge program is a platform that offers a structured remote mentoring program for **college students** who have successfully completed talent plan courses or contributed to TiDB projects. Open source projects related to TiDB ecosystems will be selected together with professional mentors. Students can apply for the projects, one at a time, and finish the projects with the help of the mentors in a given time. Mentees gain real-world experiences by working closely with mentors. Students who successfully complete the projects will receive **bonus and better job opportunities**.
