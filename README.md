# Welcome to learn Talent Plan Courses!

![Talent Plan Logo](media/talent-plan-logo.png)

Talent Plan is an open source training program initiated by PingCAP. It aims to create or combine some open source learning materials for people interested in open source, distributed systems, Rust, Golang, and other infrastructure knowledges. As such, a series of courses focused on open source collaboration, rust programming, distributed database and systems are provided.

> Note:

> Each course is developed independently, so they vary in their presentation and their expectations from course-takers. Please see the individual course documentation for details.

## Our Courses

### Series 1: Open Source Collaboration

Open source collaboration includes a series of open source related learning mateials to help open source enthusiasts have a basic knowledge of what open source software is, the differences among kinds of open source software licenses, how to participate in open source projects and what a welcoming open source community looks like. Courses of this series are:

- [TP 101: Introduction to open source software](courses/tp101-intro-to-oss.md)
- [TP 102: How to use Git and GitHub](courses/tp102-how-to-use-git-github.md)
- [TP 103: Build a welcoming community](courses/tp103-open-source-community.md)

### Series 2: Rust Programming

Two courses are included in this series, which are:

- [TP 201: Practical Networked Applications in Rust](courses/rust/README.md). A series of projects that incrementally develop a single Rust project from the ground up into a high-performance, networked, parallel and asynchronous key/value store. Along the way various real-world and practical Rust development subject matter are explored and discussed.

- [TP 202: Distributed Systems in Rust](courses/dss/README.md). Adapted from the [MIT 6.824](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2017/index.html) distributed systems coursework, this course focuses on implementing important distributed algorithms, including the [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) consensus algorithm, and the [Percolator](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/36726.pdf) distributed transaction protocol.

### Series 3: Distributed Database 

Two courses are included in this series, which are:

- [TP 301: TinySQL, a distributed relational database in Go](https://github.com/pingcap-incubator/tinysql)
- [TP 302: TinyKV, a distributed key value database in Go](https://github.com/pingcap-incubator/tinykv) 

### Series 4: Deep Dive into TiDB Ecosystems 

- TP 401: Deep Dive into TiDB(WIP)
- TP 402: Deep Dive into TiKV(WIP)
