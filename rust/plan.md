# Practical Networked Applications in Rust - Lesson plan

This course is divided into five _sections_, each with a _project_ designed to
give you exposure to practical Rust programming subjects. Each section's
_lessons_ and accompanying external pre-requisite _readings_ provide the
resources necessary to complete the projects.

Note that it is not sufficient to follow the lessons without reading the
external reading material. The readings are the foundation necessary to
understand and complete the projects; the lessons themselves are intended to
provide additional insight and in-depth explorations beyond the background
reading.

Each project builds on experience from the previous project. It is reasonable to
start each project by copy-pasting the previous.

A suggested workflow:

- Skim the project for the next section to get an idea of what you need to learn
  from the next lessons.
- Prior to following a lesson, read the pre-requisite readings.
- During the lesson, follow the slides, and
  - if taking the course live, ask questions
  - if taking the course online, read the writeups that accompany the slides
- Follow each project according to their own instructions, writing Rust programs
  that pass the projects' accompanying tests.

As you work through the course content, _please_ be on the lookout for things
you would improve about the course, and either [submit issues][si] explaining,
or [submit pull requests][spr] with improvements. _Each accepted pull request
counts toward extra credit during final evaluation_. Pull requests to any other
project used during this course count as well. This is an opportunity to gain
experience contributing to an open-source Rust project. Make this a better
course for the next student to take it than it was for you. That is how open
source projects evolve.

**Topics**: `#[test]`, how does test work?, what does `cargo run` actually do?,
clippy, rustfmt, controlling clippy and rustfmt, links to other useful tools,
cargo / rustc wrapping pattern in depth (ex rustup, `RUSTC_WRAPPER`)


### [Lesson: Formatting, println et. al, log, and slog][t-fmt] ([slides][s-fmt])

**Readings**:
 - [The Book - Macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html)

`log` demo, `slog` and structured logging, `env_logger`, APIs that take format
strings




## Section 2 (File I/O)


### [Project: File I/O][p-fs]

**Task**: Create a persistent key/value store that can be accessed from the
command line

**Goals**:

- Read the state of the key/value store from disk
- Use serde for serialization
- Use file I/O APIs to binary search

**Topics**: `failure` crate, `std::net::fs`, `Read` / `Write` traits,
serde

**Extensions**: range queries, store data using bitcast algo?

unwinding

### [Lesson: Collections and iterators][t-coll] ([slides][s-coll])




## Section 3 (Networking)


### [Project: Networking][p-net]

## TODOs

- reduce scope
- fmt subject isn't _necessary_ but is a deep-dive topic
- need to have a "how to get help" section somewhere
