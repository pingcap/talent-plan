# PNA Rust Project 1: The Rust toolbox

**Task**: Create an in-memory key/value store that passes simple tests and responds
to command-line arguments.

**Goals**:

- Install the Rust compiler and tools
- Learn the project structure used throughout this course
- Use `cargo init` / `run` / `test` / `clippy` / `fmt`
- Learn how to find and import crates from crates.io
- Define an appropriate data type for a key-value store

**Topics**: testing, the `clap` crate, `CARGO_VERSION` etc., the `clippy` and
  `rustfmt` tools.

**Extensions**: the `structopt` crate.


## Introduction

In this project you will create a simple in-memory key/value store that maps
strings to strings, and that passes some tests and responds to command line
arguments. The focus of this project is on the tooling and setup that goes into
a typical Rust project.

If this sounds basic to you, please do the project anyway as it discusses some
general patterns that will be used throughout the course.


## Project spec

The cargo project, `kvs`, builds a command-line key-value store client called
`kvs`, which in turn calls into a library called `kvs`.

The `kvs` executable supports the following command line arguments:

- `kvs set <KEY> <VALUE>`

  Set the value of a string key to a string

- `kvs get <KEY>`

  Get the string value of a given string key

- `kvs rm <KEY>`

  Remove a given key

- `kvs -V`

  Print the version

The `kvs` library contains a type, `KvStore`, that supports the following
methods:

- `KvStore::set(&mut self, key: String, value: String)`

  Set the value of a string key to a string

- `KvStore::get(&mut self, key: String) -> Option<String>`

  Get the string value of the a string key. If the key does not exist,
  return `None`.

- `KvStore::remove(&mut self, key: String)`

  Remove a given key.

The `KvStore` type stores values in-memory, and thus the command-line client can
do little more than print the version. The `get`/ `set` / `rm` commands will 
return an "unimplemented" error when run from the command line. Future projects 
will store values on disk and have a working command line interface.


## Installation

At this point in your Rust programming experience you should know
how to install Rust via [rustup].

[rustup]: https://www.rustup.rs

If you haven't already, do so now by running

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

(If you are running Windows then follow the instructions on rustup.rs. Note
though that you will face more challenges than others during this course, as it
was developed on Unix. In general, Rust development on Windows is as less
polished experience than on Unix).

Verify that the toolchain works by typing `rustc -V`. If that doesn't work, log
out and log in again so that changes to the login profile made during
installation can take effect.


## Project setup

You will do the work for this project in your own git repository, with your own
Cargo project. You will import the test cases for the project from the [source
repository for this course][course].

[course]: https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan

Note that within that repository, all content related to this course is within
the `rust` subdirectory. You may ignore any other directories.

The projects in this course contain both libraries and executables. They are
executables because we are developing an application that can be run. They are
libraries because the supplied test cases must link to them.

We'll use the same setup for each project in this course.

The directory layout we will use is:

```
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   ├── bin
│   │   └── kvs.rs
│   └── lib.rs
└── tests
    └── tests.rs
```

The `Cargo.toml`, `lib.rs` and `kvs.rs` files look as follows:

`Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "kvs"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Brian Anderson <andersrb@gmail.com>"]
description = "A key-value store"
edition = "2018"
```

`lib.rs`:

```rust
// just leave it empty for now
```

`kvs.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

The author should be yourself, but the name needs to be `kvs` in order for the
test cases to work. That's because the project name is also the name of the
library it contains. Likewise the name of the binary (the command line
application) needs to be `kvs`. In the above setup it will be `kvs` implicitly
based on the file name, but you could name the file whatever you wanted by
putting the appropriate information in the manifest (`Cargo.toml`).

You may set up this project with `cargo new --lib`, `cargo init --lib` (in a
clean directory), or manually. You'll probably also want to initialize a git
repository in the same directory.

Finally, the `tests` directory is copied from the course materials. In this case,
copy from the course repository the file `rust/projects/project-1/tests`
into your own repository, as `tests`.

At this point you should be able to run the program with `cargo run`.

_Try it now._

You are set up for this project and ready to start hacking.


## Part 1: Make the tests compile

You've been provided with a suite of unit tests in `tests/tests.rs`. Open it up
and take a look.

_Try to run the tests with `cargo test`._ What happens? Why?

Your first task for this project is to make the tests _compile_. Fun!

If your project is like mine you probably saw a huge spew of build errors. Look
at the first few. In general, when you see a bunch of errors, the first are the
most important &mdash; `rustc` will keep trying to compile even after hitting
errors, so errors can cascade, the later ones being pretty meaningless. Your
first few errors probably look like:

```
error[E0433]: failed to resolve: use of undeclared type or module `assert_cmd`
 --> tests/tests.rs:1:5
  |
1 | use assert_cmd::prelude::*;
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^ use of undeclared type or module `assert_cmd`

error[E0432]: unresolved import
 --> tests/tests.rs:3:5
  |
3 | use predicates::str::contains;
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

(If you are seeing something else, please file an issue).

These two errors are quite hard to diagnose to a new Rust programmer so I'll
just tell you what's going on here: you are missing [dev-dependency] crates
in your manifest.

[dev-dependency]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#development-dependencies

For this project your `Cargo.toml` file needs to contain these lines:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
assert_cmd = "0.11.0"
predicates = "1.0.0"
```

The details of these dependencies are not important to you completing the
project, but you might want to investigate them on your own. We didn't tell you
about the need for dev-deps earlier just so you would experience these errors
yourself. In future projects, the setup text will tell you the dev-deps you
need.

One quick note: how can you figure out that these errors are due to missing
dependencies in your manifest and not due to errors in your source code? Here's
one big clue, from the error shown previously:

```
1 | use assert_cmd::prelude::*;
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^ use of undeclared type or module `assert_cmd`
```

In `use` statements the first path element is always the name of a crate. The
exception to this is when the first path element references a name that was
previously brought into scope with _another_ `use` statement. In other words, if
there had been another `use` statement in this file like `use foo::assert_cmd`,
then use `assert_cmd::prelude::*` would refer to _that_ `assert_cmd`. There is
more that could be said about this but we shouldn't go deeper into the nuances
of path resolution here. Just know that, in general, in a `use` statement, if
the first element in the path isn't found (i.e. cannot be resolved), the problem
is probably that the crate hasn't been named in the manifest.

Whew. That is an unfortunate diversion in the very first project. But hopefully
instructive.

_Go ahead and add the appropriate dev-deps to your manifest._

Try again to run the tests with `cargo test`. What happens? Why?

Hopefully those _previous_ errors are gone. Now the errors are all about the
test cases not being able to find all the code it expects in your own code.

_So now your task is to outline all the types, methods, etc. necessary to make
the tests build._

During this course you will read the test cases a lot. The test cases tell you
exactly what is expected of your code. If the text and the tests don't agree,
the tests are right (file a bug!). This is true in the real world too. The test
cases demonstrate what the software _actually_ does. They are reality. Get used
to reading test cases.

And, bonus &mdash; test cases are often the poorest-written code in any project,
sloppy and undocumented.

Again, try to run the tests with `cargo test`. What happens? Why?

In `src/lib.rs` write the type and method definitions necessary to make `cargo
test --no-run` complete successfully. Don't write any method bodies yet &mdash;
instead write `panic!()`. This is the way to sketch out your APIs without
knowing or caring about the implementation (there's also the [`unimplemented!`]
macro, but since typing it is longer, it's common to simply use `panic!`, a
possible exception being if you are releasing software that contains
unimplemented methods).

[`unimplemented!`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.unimplemented.html

_Do that now before moving on._

Once that is done, if you run `cargo test` (without `--no-run`),
you should see that some of your tests are failing, like

```
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.32s
     Running target/debug/deps/kvs-b03a01e7008067f6

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out

     Running target/debug/deps/kvs-a3b5a004932c6715

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out

     Running target/debug/deps/tests-5e1c2e20bd1fa377

running 13 tests
test cli_get ... FAILED
test cli_invalid_get ... FAILED
test cli_invalid_rm ... FAILED
test cli_invalid_set ... FAILED
test cli_no_args ... FAILED
test cli_invalid_subcommand ... FAILED
... more lines of spew ...
```

... followed by many more lines. That's great! That's all we need right now.
You'll make those pass throughout the rest of this project.


## Aside: Testing tips

If you look again at the output from `cargo test` you'll see something
interesting:

```
     Running target/debug/deps/kvs-b03a01e7008067f6

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out

     Running target/debug/deps/kvs-a3b5a004932c6715

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out

     Running target/debug/deps/tests-5e1c2e20bd1fa377


running 13 tests
test cli_get ... FAILED
```

Cargo says "Running ..." three times. And the first two of those times it in
fact did not run any tests. And furthermore, if all those tests hadn't failed,
cargo would have run _yet another_ set of tests.

Why is this?

Well, it is because there are many places you can write tests in Rust:

- Inside the source of your library
- Inside the source of each of your binaries
- Inside each test file
- In the doc comments of your library

And cargo doesn't know which of these actually contain tests, so it just builds
and runs them all.

So those two sets of empty tests:

```
     Running target/debug/deps/kvs-b03a01e7008067f6
running 0 tests
     Running target/debug/deps/kvs-a3b5a004932c6715
running 0 tests
```

Well, this is a bit confusing, but one of them is your library, compiled for
testing, and the other is your binary, compiled for testing. Neither contains
any tests. The reason both have "kvs" in their names is because both your
library and your binary are called "kvs".

All this test spew gets annoying, and there are two ways to quiet cargo:
with command line arguments, and with changes to the manifest.

Here are the relevant command line flags:

- `cargo test --lib` &mdash; test just the tests inside the library
- `cargo test --doc` &mdash; test the doc tests in the library
- `cargo test --bins` &mdash; test all the bins in the project
- `cargo test --bin foo` &mdash; test just the `foo` bin
- `cargo test --doc` &mdash; test the libraries doc tests
- `cargo test --test foo` &mdash; test the tests in test file `foo`

These are convenient to quickly hide test spew, but if a project doesn't contain
a type of tests it's probably best to just never deal with them. If you recall
from The Cargo Book's [manifest description][m], there are two keys that can be
applied: `test = false` and `doctest = false`. They go in the `[lib]` and
`[[bin]]` sections. Consider updating your manifest.

[m]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

Another quick thing to do if you haven't before. Run this:

```
cargo test -- --help
```

Just do it. It's cool. What you are seeing there is the help information for
_the executable containing your compiled tests_ (that `--` surrounded by spaces
tells cargo to pass all following arguments to the test binary). It's not
the same info displayed when you run `cargo test --help`. They are two different
things: cargo is running your test bin by passing it all these various arguments.

If you want you can do exactly the same thing. Let's go back one more time
to our `cargo test` example. We saw this line:

```
     Running target/debug/deps/kvs-b03a01e7008067f6
```

That's cargo telling you the name of the test binary. You can run it
yourself, like `target/debug/deps/kvs-b03a01e7008067f6 --help`.

The `target` directory contains lots of cool stuff. Digging through it can teach
you a lot about what the Rust toolchain is actually doing.

In practice, particularly with large projects, you won't run the entire test
suite while developing a single feature. To narrow down the set of tests to the
ones we care about, run the following:

```
cargo test cli_no_args
```

This will run the test called `cli_no_args`. In fact, it will run any test
containing `cli_no_args` in the name, so if, e.g., you want to run all the CLI
tests, you can run `cargo test cli`. That's probably how you will be running the
tests yourself as you work through the project, otherwise you will be distracted
by the many failing tests that you have not yet fixed. Unfortunately that
pattern is a simple substring match, not something fancy like a regular
expression.

<!-- TODO: need an excuse to explain `cargo test --test suite`.
Per https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/pull/129#issuecomment-498477590
we might organize the the test suite into test files by project section.
Then we could talk about `cargo test --test part-1` -->

Note that, as of this writing, the test cases for the projects in this course
are not organized in a way that makes it clear which test cases should complete
for any particular section of a project &mdash; only that by the end the entire
suite should pass. You'll need to read the names and implementations of the
tests to figure out which you _think_ should pass at any particular time.


## Part 2: Accept command line arguments

The key / value stores throughout this course are all controlled through a
command-line client. In this project the command-line client is very simple
because the state of the key-value store is only stored in memory, not persisted
to disk.

In this part you will make the `cli_*` test cases pass.

Recall how to run individual test cases from previous sections
of 

Again, the interface for the CLI is:

- `kvs set <KEY> <VALUE>`

  Set the value of a string key to a string

- `kvs get <KEY>`

  Get the string value of a given string key

- `kvs rm <KEY>`

  Remove a given key

- `kvs -V`

  Print the version

In this iteration though, the `get` and `set` commands will print to stderr the
string, "unimplemented", and exiting with a non-zero exit code, indicating an
error.

You will use the `clap` crate to handle command-line arguments.

_Find the latest version of the `clap` crate and add it to your dependencies in
`Cargo.toml`._ There are a number of ways to find and import a crate, but
pro-tip: check out the built-in [`cargo search`] and the plug-in [`cargo edit`].

[`cargo search`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-search.html
[`cargo edit`]: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit

<!-- note: above is basically assuming that by now they know about
crates.io, so expanding their world with the two CLI commands. -->

<i>Next use [crates.io], [lib.rs], or [docs.rs] to find the documentation for
the `clap` crate, and implement the command line interface such that the `cli_*`
test cases pass.</i>

<!-- note: above casually mentioning lib.rs and docs.rs to make sure they are aware. -->

When you are testing, use `cargo run`; do not run the executable directly from
the `target/` directory. When passing arguments to the program, separate them
from the `cargo run` command with two dashes, `--`, like `cargo run -- get
key1`.

[crates.io]: https://crates.io
[lib.rs]: https://lib.rs
[docs.rs]: https://docs.rs


## Part 3: Cargo environment variables

When you set up `clap` to parse your command line arguments, you probably set
the name, version, authors, and description (if not, do so). This information is
redundant w/ values provided in `Cargo.toml`. Cargo sets environment variables
that can be accessed through Rust source code, at build time.

_Modify your `clap` setup to set these values from standard cargo environment
variables._


## Part 4: Store values in memory

Now that your command line scaffolding is done, let's turn to the implementation
of `KvStore`, and make the remaining test cases pass.

The behavior of `KvStore`'s methods are fully-defined through the test cases
themselves &mdash; you don't need any further description to complete the
code for this project.

_Make the remaining test cases pass by implementing methods on `KvStore`._


## Part 5: Documentation

You have implemented the project's functionality, but there are still a few more
things to do before it is a polished piece of Rust software, ready for
contributions or publication.

First, public items should generally have doc comments.

Doc comments are displayed in a crate's API documentation. API documentation can
be generated with the command, `cargo doc`, which will render them as HTML to
the `target/doc` folder. Note though that `target/doc` folder does not contain
an `index.html`. In this project, your crate's documentation will be located at
`target/doc/kvs/index.html`. You can launch a web browser at that location with
`cargo doc --open`. `cargo doc --open` doesn't always work, e.g. if you are
ssh'd into a cloud instance. If it doesn't though the command will print the
name of the html file it couldn't open &mdash; useful simply for finding the
location of your API docs.

[Good doc comments][gdc] do not just repeat the name of the function, nor repeat
information gathered from the type signature. They explain why and how one would
use a function, what the return value is on both success and failure, error and
panic conditions. The library you have written is very simple so the
documentation can be simple as well. If you truly cannot think of anything
useful to add through doc comments then it can be ok to not add a doc comment
(this is a matter of preference). With no doc comments it should be obvious how
the type or function is used from the name and type signature alone.

Doc comments contain examples, and those examples can be tested with `cargo test
--doc`.

_Add `#![deny(missing_docs)]` to the top of `src/lib.rs` to enforce that all
public items have doc comments. Then add doc comments to the types and methods
in your library. Follow the [documentatine guidelines][gdc]. Give each an
example and make sure they pass `cargo test --doc`._

[gdc]: https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/api-guidelines/documentation.html


## Part 6: Ensure good style with `clippy` and `rustfmt`

[`clippy`] and [`rustfmt`] are tools for enforcing common Rust style. `clippy`
helps ensure that code uses modern idioms, and prevents patterns that commonly
lead to errors. `rustfmt` enforces that code is formatted consistently. It's not
necessary right now, but you might click those links and read their
documentation. They are both sophisticated tools capable of much more than
described below.

[`clippy`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy
[`rustfmt`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt

Both tools are included in the Rust toolchain, but not installed by default.
They can be installed with the following [`rustup`] commands:

```
rustup component add clippy
rustup component add rustfmt
```

[`rustup`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs/blob/master/README.md

_Do that now._

Both tools are invoked as cargo subcommands, `clippy` as `cargo clippy` and
`rustfmt` as `cargo fmt`. Note that `cargo fmt` modifies your source code, so
commit your work before making before running it to avoid accidentally making
unwanted changes, after which you can either include the changes as part of the
previous commit with `git commit --amend`. Or just commit them as their own
formatting commit &mdash; it's common to rust both `clippy` and `rustfmt` after
a series of commits, e.g. before submitting a pull request.

_Run `cargo clippy` against your project and make any suggested changes. Run
`cargo fmt` against yur project and commit any changes it makes._

It's worth reading the [`rustup`], [`clippy`], and [`rustfmt`] documentation, as
these are tools you will be using frequently.

Congratulations, you are done with your first project! If you like you
may complete the remaining "extensions". They are optional.

<!-- TODO add text about discovering components, and filtering with rg -->

Nice coding, friend. Enjoy a nice break.

## Extension 1: `structopt`

In this project we used `clap` to parse command line arguments. It's typical to
represent a program's parsed command line arguments as a struct, perhaps named
`Config` or `Options`. Doing so requires calling the appropriate methods on
`clap`'s `ArgMatches` type. Both steps, for larger programs, require _a lot_ of
boilerplate code. The `structopt` crate greatly reduces boilerplate by allowing
you to define a `Config` struct, annotated to automatically produce a `clap`
command line parser that produces that struct. Some find this approach nicer
than writing the `clap` code explicitly.

_Modify your program to use `structopt` for parsing command line
arguments instead of using `clap` directly._
