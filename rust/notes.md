## Grading

- automated text-based cheat detection
- automated grading of test cases
- automated grading of non-unit-test requirements via python script
- how to grade freeform answers?

## TODO

- do survey of other sources' subject progression
- lessons and labs pose questions
- have a chinese native identify and remove 'hard' words and phrases
- mention somewhere that we're using rust 2018 only, how to verify
- change slides.html URLS to link to the hosted file
