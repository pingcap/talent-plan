// What follows are RPC types and methods.
// Field names must start with capital letters, otherwise RPC will break.

// DoTaskArgs holds the arguments that are passed to a worker when a job is
// scheduled on it.
type DoTaskArgs struct {
	JobName    string
	File       string   // only for map, the input file
	Phase      jobPhase // are we in mapPhase or reducePhase?
	TaskNumber int      // this task's index in the current phase

	// NumOtherPhase is the total number of tasks in other phase; mappers
	// need this to compute the number of output bins, and reducers needs
	// this to know how many input files to collect.
	NumOtherPhase int
}

// ShutdownReply is the response to a WorkerShutdown.
// It holds the number of tasks this worker has processed since it was started.
type ShutdownReply struct {
	Ntasks int
}

// RegisterArgs is the argument passed when a worker registers with the master.
type RegisterArgs struct {
	Worker string // the worker's UNIX-domain socket name, i.e. its RPC address
}

// call() sends an RPC to the rpcname handler on server srv
// with arguments args, waits for the reply, and leaves the
// reply in reply. the reply argument should be the address
// of a reply structure.
//
// call() returns true if the server responded, and false if call()
// received no reply from the server. reply's contents are valid if
// and only if call() returned true.
//
// you should assume that call() will time out and return
// false after a while if it doesn't get a reply from the server.
//
// please use call() to send all RPCs. please don't change this
// function.
