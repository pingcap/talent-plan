## Introduction

This is the Merge Sort home work for PingCAP Talent Plan Online of week 1.

NOTE: **go 1.12 is required**

## How to use

Please supplement the `MergeSort()` function defined in `mergesort.go` to accomplish
the home work.

**NOTE**:
1. There is a builtin unit test defined in `mergesort_test.go`, however, you still
   can write your own unit tests.
2. There is a builtin benchmark test defined in `bench_test.go`, you should run
   this benchmark to ensure that your parallel merge sort is fast enough.


How to test:
```
make test
```

How to benchmark:
```
make bench
```
