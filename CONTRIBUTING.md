# Contributing Guide

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to Talent Plan! Contributions of any kind are welcome.

## Ways to contribute

We love contributions from the community. Here are just a few of the ways you can contribute:

- **Report bugs:** if you find a bug while taking courses, you may want to do a quick check of past issues to see if you can find any help there. Otherwise, create a new bug issue in the course repository using the provided template.
- **Answer questions:** check out the open issues to see if you can help answer learner questions.
- **Suggest changes:** this could come in the form of a new learning outcome, updates to the content, updates to the bot responses, or the logic of the course. If you'd like, you can fork the course and suggest the change that way, but most people like to talk about it first in an issue.
- **Tackle an issue:** if you see an issue you would like to resolve, please feel free to fork the course and submit a PR (check out the instructions below).
- **Translate a course:** if you have the ability to translate a course, we'd love to see it. Please fork the course and submit a PR. We'll need a second native speaker to confirm the translation so if you have anyone in mind, please @ mention them in your PR for a review.
