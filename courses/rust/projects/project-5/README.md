# Project: Asynchrony

**Task**: Create a multi-threaded, persistent key/value store server and client
with _asynchronous_ networking over a custom protocol.

**Goals**:

- Understand the patterns used when writing Rust futures

## Introduction

_Note: this project is only outlined, not written. If you are at this point in
the course email brian@pingcap.com and let me know and I will finish writing it
ASAP._

In this project you will create a simple key/value server and client that
communicate over a custom protocol. The server will use asynchronous networking,
built on the tokio runtime. The key/value engine that reads and writes to files
will remain synchronous, scheduling work on an underlying thread pool, while
presenting an asynchronous interface. Along the way you will experiment
with multiple ways of defining and working with future types.

Because learning to program with Rust futures is especially challenging, and
existing documentation on the subject is limited, the scope of this project is
relatively modest, and it contains more direct explanation than past projects.

Be sure to read the background readings on this project. And if you get
frustrated, then forgive yourself, take a break, and try again with a fresh
mind. Writing asynchronous Rust is difficult for everybody.


## Project spec

The cargo project, `kvs`, builds a command-line key-value store client called
`kvs-client`, and a key-value store server called `kvs-server`, both of which in
turn call into a library called `kvs`. The client speaks to the server over
a custom protocol.

The interface to the CLI is the same as in the [previous project]. The engine
implementation is largely the same, distributing synchronous file I/O over
a thread pool.

The difference this time is that all the networking is performed asynchronously.

As part of the conversion to asynchrony, the `KvsClient` will present a
futures-based API, and the `KvsEngine` trait will also present a futures-based
API, even while it is implemented with blocking (synchronous) I/O via a thread
pool.

Your `KvsServer` will be based on the tokio runtime, which handles the
distribution of asynchronous work to multiple threads on its own (tokio itself
contains a thread pool). This means that your architecture will actually have
two layers of thread pools: the first handling with the networking,
asynchronously, one thread per core; the second handling the file I/O,
synchronously, with enough threads to keep the networking threads as busy as
possible.

As a result if this architectural change, where your jobs will be spawned into
your thread pool from multiple threads, your `ThreadPool` trait and its
implementations will become shared types implementing `Clone + Send + 'sync`, as
your `KvsEngine` is.

Because you will be experimenting with multiple definitions of the futures
returned by these types, they aren't fully specified here, and instead will be
specified as they are called for.

More specifically, you will work with function signatures like all the
following:

- `Client::get(&mut self, key: String) -> Box<Future<Item = Option<String>, Error = Error>`

- `Client::get(&mut self, key: String) -> future::SomeExplicitCombinator<...>`

- `Client::get(&mut self, key: String) -> impl Future<Item = Option<String>, Error = Error>`

- `Client::get(&mut self, key: String) -> ClientGetFuture`



## Project setup

Continuing from your previous project, delete your privous `tests` directory and
copy this project's `tests` directory into its place. This project should
contain a library named `kvs`, and two executables, `kvs-server` and
`kvs-client`.

You need the following dev-dependencies in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
assert_cmd = "0.11"
criterion = "0.2.11"
crossbeam-utils = "0.6.5"
predicates = "1.0.0"
rand = "0.6.5"
tempfile = "3.0.7"
walkdir = "2.2.7"
panic-control = "0.1.4"
```

Unlike with previous projects, don't bother to fill in enough type definitions
to make the test suite compile. Doing so would require jumping a number of steps
ahead at once. The text will indicate when to working with the test suite.


## Background: Thinking in futures, in Rust

- why futures? networking vs file/io, blocking vs non-blocking, sync vs async
- futures from a user persective (not a poll-centric implementation perspective)
- don't think too hard about executors and runtimes
- method chaining and how it transforms the future type
- debugging Rust types
- Result vs Future vs FutureResult
- error handling with futures
- concrete futures vs boxed futures vs anonymous futures
- note about futures 0.1 and futures 0.3 (we'll use futures 0.1)
- note about async / await


## Part 1: Introducing tokio to the client

Ultimately we're going to convert both the client and server to futures, but
since the client is so simple, that's where we'll start. And we're going to
introduce the tokio runtime first, while using your existing synchronous
`KvsClient`.

The 

for the client we're going to introduce the async runtime while keeping
the sync `KvsClient`, then convert the `KvsClient`. The `connect` method
of `KvsClient`. note that as a library `KvsClient` can offer the most
efficiency based on futures, but our kvs-client bin doesn't take advantage
of it, so the bin is going to look a bit silly running a single future
and exiting.

TODO @sticnarf - see if you can write test cases that are agnostic to the
concrete future types, so they work with all the below strategies.


## Part 2: Converting `KvsClient` to boxed futures

the path of least resistence for future types


## Part 3: `KvsClient` with explicit future types

just to have the experience of seeing how untenable it is


## Part 4: `KvsClient` with anonymous future types

the final solution


## Part 5: Making `ThreadPool` sharable


## Part 6: Converting `KvsEngine` to futures

for the server we're going to do the opposite of what we did in the client, and
give `KvsEngine` an async interface. this will show that futures and the
underlying runtime are independent, and just general provide a spectrum of
experience.


## Part 7: Driving `KvsEngine` with tokio

note that even though we have ourselves have written very little asynchronous
code, that tokio itself is distributing asynchronous work across num_cpus
threads. think about the tradeoffs of putting cpu-intensive work directly on the
network threads or the file threads, e.g. where does the serialization go?

TODO

Nice coding, friend. Enjoy a nice break.

## Extension 1: Converting to tokio-fs

not sure if this should be required or an extension


<!--

TODO:
- can we find an excuse to write a future by hand?

- background readings
  - something on associated types

> As there is only the outline of project 5, I write the code mostly according to
my own thoughts. Hope this will be a reference while you're writing the text.
@brson

> I change the concurrent_get/set tests to use async. Students should change their
SledKvsEngine and KvStore to adapt to the KvsEngine trait with new async APIs.
The engines have a ThreadPool type parameter and the constructor has a
concurrency argument (maybe we should remove it). Students need to follow the
design so that the test will work.

> I don't test the client. Implementors can choose the API design of the client
themselves (unless we work out a perfect design so we can just give instructions
to students).
